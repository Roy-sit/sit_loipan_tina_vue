#### Project Title:
VUE AND AJAX ASSIGNMENT

#### Project Description:
Description:
The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the basic concepts of connecting a Vue.js frontend to a Lumen API they will create in their web development class. The API will contain a sorted listing of entries and a single entry endpoint. Working in pairs students will gain hands-on experience in creating a simple web application that fetches and displays data from their own API.

Requirements:
Create a basic Vue.js application with a single HTML file and a Vue instance. (Submissions with vue single file components will not be accepted, e.g. files that end with .vue)
Use the Vue instance to fetch data from the Lumen API (You must create and populate your own API).
Display the sorted listing of entries on the webpage.
Implement a feature that allows users to click on an entry to view the details of that specific entry (Connect to a third-party API)
Display the details on the webpage without navigating to a different page.
Ensure proper error handling for failed API requests as well as display loading indicators as required.
The page must be responsive from mobile to desktop.
Additional GreenSock enhancements and features are strongly encouraged.
